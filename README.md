Personal tools. start and thank author if you find these tools useful.

## idcount
"idcount" is a tool for counting the identifier used in a project. Initially I invented this tool in order to check spelling and specifications.

## nocomment
I invented this tool when I was reading boost::circular_buffer. Exactly, there are SO MANY doxygen comments!

## linenumber
Add linenumber for codes before I print them.

## zalt
A very weird Lisp-like language. You must `$` everything you'd like to evaluate explicitly.

## typeAssert
A small library for type assertions in JavaScript. The story continues in [this repo](https://github.com/ICEYSELF/TypeAssert), and the UMD file here is a legacy option.
