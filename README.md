# Kits
Personal tools. start and thank author if you find these tools useful.

## httpd
A minimal http server written in Rust, suitable if you want to serve something while not bundling too many stuff.

## idcount
"idcount" is a tool for counting the identifier used in a project. Initially I invented this tool in order to check spelling and specifications.

## nocomment
I invented this tool when I was reading boost::circular_buffer. Exactly, there are SO MANY doxygen comments!

## linenumber
Add linenumber for codes before I print them.

## zalt
A very weird Lisp-like language. You must `$` everything you'd like to evaluate explicitly.

## typeAssert
A small library for type assertions in JavaScript. The story continues in [this repo](https://github.com/ICEYSELF/TypeAssert), and the UMD file here is a legacy option.

## tyconv
Converts between YAML and TOML, with certain restrictions.

## dont-werror.py
Some big companies are too confident to their code quality and they enable `-Werror` in even "production" code, crashing downstream builds from time to time. Use this script to "hook" or "hijack" your C compiler, and make both you and your compiler happier.
